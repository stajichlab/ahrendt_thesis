  \caption[Heatmap cluster analysis of flagellar proteins from \textit{Naegleria gruberi}]{A subset of proteins which cluster according to presence/absence in flagellated and non-flagellated organisms. Protein copies identified in proteomes of interest are normalized to indicate presence and absence only, where green indicates that one or more copies were found.}
