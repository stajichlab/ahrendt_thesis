  \caption[Inhibition of \textit{N. crassa} is observed with \textit{H. polyrhiza} and not other chytrids.]{\textit{Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis} JEL 423 (\textit{Bd}), the closest relative of \textit{Hp}, is well known as a global emerging pathogen of amphibians and is the causative agent for recent worldwide amphibian decline. \textit{Spizellomyces punctatus} SW-1 (\textit{Sp}) is a soil saprobe and is not known to be pathogenic. A) \textit{Hp} cultured with \textit{N. crassa} produces a cleared zone. B) \textit{Bd}, C) \textit{Sp}, D) \textit{Operculomyces laminatus} JEL 223, E) \textit{Rhizoclosmatium hyalinus} JEL 800, F) \textit{Obelidium mucronatum} JEL 802 do not display this property. Black scale bars = 1mm. Black arrowheads illustrate location of chytrid sporangia.}

  \caption[Inhibitory properties of \textit{H. polyrhiza} are not specific to \textit{N. crassa}.]{A selection of fungal species from the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mucorales were assayed for sensitivity against \textit{Hp} sporangia. A) \textit{Neurospora crassa} (Sordariomycetes; Sordariales; Sordariaceae), B) \textit{Neurospora tetrasperma}, C) \textit{Neurospora discreta}, D) \textit{Trichoderma reesei} (Sordariomycetes; Hypocreales; Hypocreaceae), E) \textit{Aspergillus nidulans} (Eurotiomycetes; Eurotiales; Trichocomaceae), F) \textit{Coprinopsis cinerea} (Agaricomycetes; Agaricales; Psathyrellaceae), G) \textit{Ashbya gossypii} (Saccharomycetes; Saccharomycetales; Saccharomycetaceae), H) \textit{Phycomyces blakesleeanus} (Mucorales; Phycomycetaceae), and I) \textit{Rhizopus oryzae} (Mucorales; Mucoraceae). Scale bars for A-C,H-I = 1mm. Scale bars for D-G = 5mm. Black arrowheads in A-C,H-I indicate \textit{Hp} sporangia. White arrowheads in A-G indicate blocks of agar with active \textit{Hp} sporangia.}

  \caption[Filter-sterilized \textit{Hp}-conditioned media effectively inhibits \textit{N. crassa} growth.]{Test tubes containing filter-sterilized \textit{Hp}-conditioned media ("filtrate") were inoculated with \textit{N. crassa} conidia and left to incubate at room temperature for 96h (see methods for more detail). For A), B), and C), filtrate was derived from initial preparations of \textit{Hp} alone, \textit{N. crassa} alone, and \textit{Hp}+\textit{N. crassa}, respectively. Panel B) establishes that nutrient limitation is not responsible for inhibitory observation as growth of \textit{N. crassa} can still be supported, while A) and C) establish that \textit{Hp} is not exhibiting this behavior as a response to the presence of another fungus. D), E), F), G) contain \textit{Hp}-derived mPmTG filtrate after low (-20$^{\circ}$C), high (60$^{\circ}$C), ultra-low (-80$^{\circ}$) and ultra-high (90$^{\circ}$) temperature treatments, respectively. For D-G, N. crassa inoculation occurred after media was allowed to return to room temperature. H) \textit{N. crassa} growth in fresh mPmTG media.}

A pH of 6.8 represents the standard pH at which the respective optimal media is prepared. B) \textit{Hp} growth after x days at various temperatures ranging from y$^{\circ}$C to z$^{\circ}$C.}

After 72 hours post-inoculation of \textit{N. crassa}, zones of inhibition are clearly visible surrounding \textit{H. polyrhiza} sporangia. White arrowheads in A and B indicate agar blocks containing or lacking, respectively, \textit{H. polyrhiza} sporangia. Black arrowheads indicate point of inoculation with \textit{N. crassa} conidia. Plates are 100mm in diameter.}

After a 72hour incubation at room temperature, the liquid suspension was removed and plated on 1\% Tryptone agar plates. Plates were examined after 14d room temperature incubation. Zoospore suspensions were drawn from A) filtrate preparations and B) fresh mPmTG preparations.}
