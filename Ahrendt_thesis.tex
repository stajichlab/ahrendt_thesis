% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{acknowledgements}
There were many people to whom I am deeply indebted for their contribution to the publication of this dissertation. First and foremost, my research advisor and mentor Dr. Jason Stajich, who allowed me both the freedom and guidance necessary to see this research to completion. My co-advisor, Dr. Chia-en Angelina Chang, whose input and assistance helped provide a fresh perspective on aspects of this research. From my undergraduate internships, my advisor Dr. Jamie Foster at the Kennedy Space Center and her graduate student Jen, without whose inspiration and advice I would never have pursued graduate school at all. I would like to extend a huge thank you to the members of the Stajich and Chang labs, and especially to the undergraduate students I mentored; also to the members of the Borkovich lab, whose equipment and expertise I borrowed early and often. All of my committee members, Dr. Jason Stajich, Dr. Angelina Chang, and Dr. Katherine Borkovich, who guided me through this entire process. My parents, without whose constant support I would not be here today. And finally to Kat, who stuck it out with me until the end, for which I am eternally grateful.\\
The text of this dissertation, in part or in full, is a reprint of the material as it appears in \cite{James2013}. The co-author, Dr. Jason Stajich, listed in this publication directed and supervised the research which forms the basis for this dissertation.\\
