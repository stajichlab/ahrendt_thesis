% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{acknowledgements}
There were many people who contributed immensly to the publication of this dissertation, and to whom I am deeply indebtted. First and foremost, my research mentor Dr. Jason Stajich, a mentor in every sense of the word, who allowed me the freedom to pursue my own directions while simultaneously providing the guidance to see this dissertation to completion. My co-advisor, Dr. Angelina Chang, whose input gave a fresh perspective on aspects of this research. My undergraduate advisor Dr. Jamie Foster at the Kennedy Space Center, without whose inspiration I would never have pursued graduate research at all. My good friend Jen Mobbes, who taught me all about being a graduate student. I would like to extend a huge thank you to the members of the Stajich lab, specifically former postdoc John Abramayan, and the ever-capable undergraduate students Na Jeong, Sapphire Ear, Dylan McVay, and Spencer Swanson; also to the members of the Borkovich lab, whose equipment and expertise I borrowed early and often. All of my committee members, Dr. Jason Stajich, Dr. Angelina Chang, and Dr. Katherine Borkovich, who guided me through this entire process. My parents, without whose constant support I would not be here today. And finally Kat, who stuck it out with me until the end, for which I am eternally grateful.\\
The text of this dissertation, in part or in full, is a reprint of the material as it appears in \cite{James2013}. The co-authors, Drs. Jason Stajich and Chia-en Chang, listed in these publications directed and supervised the research which forms the basis for this dissertation.\\
